8,"My personal take on the application of ChatGPT until today: it is excellent as a writing and coding assistant. It gives a detailed evaluation of my work like a master. However, as an information provider, it is not credible. For factual information, I should never rely on it.","My personal take on the application of ChatGPT until today: it is excellent as a writing and coding assistant.

If they did it for 2022 until today, there are some other media channels/outlets/sites/apps that would show even greater growth.
