8,"My personal take on the application of ChatGPT until today: it is excellent as a writing and coding assistant. It gives a detailed evaluation of my work like a master. However, as an information provider, it is not credible. For factual information, I should never rely on it.","My personal take on the application of ChatGPT until today: it is excellent as a writing and coding assistant.

Until today, I never used ChatGPT to help me with something concrete. But I decided to try it to assist my JavaScript/Puppeteer guide writing.

If they did it for 2022 until today, there are some other media channels/outlets/sites/apps that would show even greater growth.

Bing wasn't on the list but they are about to be.  Chat GPT has well over 1mm daily users, and I don't know how many users TikTok has. BOOM!","  Yes sir.
